#STEPS::


#switched shell to tsch using:  chsh -s /bin/sh

#add to .tcshrc file:
	setenv IDL_DIR /usr/local/itt/idl/idl81
#The IDL_DIR variable sets the location of the current licensed version of IDL
	setenv CVS_RSH ssh

	mkdir cvs

#get the most recent spec2d.tar.gz, put it into ~/cvs and unpack it there using:

	gunzip -vf spec2d.v1_1_4.tar.gz 

#now unpack the package using:

	tar xvf spec2d.v1_1_4.tar 

#The spec2d code should now be found in the ~/cvs/spec2d/pro directory, the linelists in the ~/cvs/spec2d/etc directory, and so forth.

#get idl_utils (find the most recent one, I found v5_5_5), place in cvs, unpack tarball using:

	tar xvf idlutils-v5_5_5.tar

#and idl_utils subdir now exist under cvs. you can delete the .tar for this now

#~~~~~~~~~~~~

#to install the utils package, type these lines into the terminal:
	setenv   IDLUTILS_DIR   ~/cvs/idlutils-v5_5_5 
#(change this to your version)
	setenv   PATH   $IDLUTILS_DIR/bin:$PATH 
	setenv   IDL_PATH   +$IDLUTILS_DIR/goddard/pro:$IDL_PATH   
#(this step could be "setenv IDL_PATH +$IDLUTILS_DIR/goddard/pro" if IDL_PATH is unset initially)
#The IDL_PATH variable sets the path of directories that are searched for IDL scripts when you issue a command.  There are IDL built-in routines in $IDL_DIR/lib, and there's a very useful library of astronomical IDL routines (including such things as FITS file readers, coordinate precession routines, etc.) maintained at GSFC which I've put into /usr/local/rsi/external/lib.   You can put your own IDL scripts into /home/yourname/idl/lib or in a subdirectory of that.

	setenv   IDL_PATH   +$IDLUTILS_DIR/pro:$IDL_PATH

#(I added these variables to my .tcshrc since i had to debug the evilmake all issue over multiple sessions)

	cd   $IDLUTILS_DIR 
	evilmake   all

#This creates a variety of library (.so) files in the directory ~/cvs/idlutils/lib/ (a.k.a. '$IDLUTILS_DIR/lib')

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
#It didnt do this the first dozen times we tried to evilmake all because of an incorrect path link to export.h. fix this via ::

	rm export.h

#from '$IDLUTILS_DIR/include', replace it with the proper link via:

	ln -s /usr/local/itt/idl/idl81/external/export.h export.h
#-----------------------------------------------------------------


#Create your .idlenv file and a .idlstartup file, typically located in your home directory (~). Make sure that the Goddard IDL Astronomy Library setup code is called within. (This is located under $IDLUTILS_DIR/goddard, however it is an older version of the contents of astron.dir.tar.gz. You can get the newest version from <https://idlastro.gsfc.nasa.gov/>)
#The IDL_STARTUP (the first line of .idlenv) gives the pathname to a file that gets executed each time an IDL session starts.  

#In order to reference the goddard "setup code" in the .idlstartup file, i need to know what its called as well as what to actually put into the file...
#It seems like im looking for a file within $IDLUTILS_DIR/goddard which i can reference in .idlstartup...

	!PATH=!PATH+':'+Expand_Path('+~/cvs/idlutils-v5_5_5/goddard/')

#*** you must source your idl environment file in your .tcshrc:

	source ~/.idlenv

# added '\' before IDL_PATH setenv in .idlenv as this is what <http://www.physics.uci.edu/~barth/astro-computing/idlsetup.html> does.
#***FIX IDLENV DATA PATH when the actual data has a location
